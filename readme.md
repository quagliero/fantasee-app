#### See more from your fantasy league.

The nfl.com fantasy site and apps are getting better, but they lack more in-depth cumulative historical data for your league. Which is a shame because the information is all there. I'm talking overall records, head-to-heads, playoff appearances, total trades, most common trading partners, etc etc, and any and all other information that can be gleaned from scraping your league history into a db and querying the data.
